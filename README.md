# Courier Management System - Database and Java Application

## Overview
The Courier Management System is designed to manage the operations of a courier service, including handling users, couriers, employees, locations, payments, and services. The project involves SQL database design, control flow, loops, exception handling, and object-oriented programming using Java.

The project is divided into multiple tasks, each building on the previous one, culminating in a fully functional courier management system with a strong focus on database interaction and unit testing.

## Tasks

### Database Design

- **Task 1 (Database Design)**: Created a database schema for the Student Information System with tables for User, Courier, Employee, Location, Payment, and CourierServices and also inserted values in the tables.
- **Task 2 (SQL Queries)**: Tested SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- **Task 3 (SQL Queries)**: Performed queries using aggregate functions, joins, and GROUP BY.
- **Task 4 (SQL Queries)**: Use subqueries and implement object-oriented programming concepts in Java.
